            <img src="assets/images/My family.JPG">

            <p>My name is Dustin Martinez, I recently became a stay at home dad.
                Thats right! I said it! "Stay at home dad".
                My wife and I came to the agreement that I should focus on raising
                our 8 month old son, and pursue a new career in coding. I was working 
                as a Flood Insurance advisor but started to get really burnt out and tired of 
                answering calls, and doing the samething everyday. So I decided to search
                for new oppurtunities, and I discovered a coding boot camp with UTSA. I am
                currently attending classes and I am very eager to learn as much
                as I can. I hope this leads to an exciting new career.
